## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone -b vue-2 https://github.com/PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-web-example-vue.git
cd pspdfkit-web-example-vue-2
```

Install the project dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

## Vue Component

The Vue component which implements the PSPDFKit for Web integration is included at `src/App.vue` with the rest of the example.

In order to make the PSPDFKit for Web's library available for building, we have to copy the `pspdfkit-lib/` directory from `node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/` into the `public/js/` directory. This is done in the `package.json` script `verify-installation` which is executed by `serve`.

## Running the Example

We are ready to launch the app! ðŸŽ‰

```bash
npm run serve
```

You can now open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and enjoy!
